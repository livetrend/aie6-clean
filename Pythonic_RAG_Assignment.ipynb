    "\n",
    "    When you're generating embeddings for a large number of texts, the asynchronous approach means you can send several requests without waiting for each one to finish. This is particularly useful because :\n",
    "    - embedding generation often involves API calls to remote servers\n",
    "    - These calls have latency times (waiting time for response).\n",
    "    - During these latencies, your program may be doing something else.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - Your CPU isn't tied up waiting for responses\n",
    "    - You can process other tasks during waiting times\n",
    "    - The program remains responsive even during processing\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Optimized batch processing\n",
    "    - You can launch several embedding requests in parallel\n",
    "    - Results are processed as they arrive\n",
    "    - No need to wait for the whole batch to finish before starting processing\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Adaptability\n",
    "    - Works well with APIs that have rate limits\n",

    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicities sake."

      "Writing a loop in Python can depend on what you want to achieve, as well as on the context of your task. However, here are some common ways to write loops effectively:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Using `for` Loops\n",
      "The `for` loop is often the most straightforward way to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string).\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of a for loop\n",
      "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
      "for fruit in fruits:\n",
      "    print(fruit)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Using `while` Loops\n",
      "The `while` loop is useful when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of a while loop\n",
      "count = 0\n",
      "while count < 5:\n",
      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Looping with `enumerate()`\n",
      "If you need access to both the index and the value during iteration, you can use `enumerate()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Using enumerate to get index and value\n",
      "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
      "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
      "    print(f\"{index}: {fruit}\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. List Comprehensions\n",
      "For simple loops that generate lists, consider using list comprehensions. They provide a concise way to create lists.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of a list comprehension\n",
      "squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
      "print(squares)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Using the `break` and `continue` Statements\n",
      "You can control the flow of your loops with `break` (to exit the loop) and `continue` (to skip to the next iteration).\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Using break and continue\n",
      "for number in range(10):\n",
      "    if number == 5:\n",
      "        break  # exits the loop when number is 5\n",
      "    if number % 2 == 0:\n",
      "        continue  # skips the rest of the loop for even numbers\n",
      "    print(number)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Tips for Writing Loops\n",
      "- **Keep it simple:** If a loop starts to get too complex, consider breaking it into a separate function.\n",
      "- **Optimize performance:** If iterating over large data sets, consider using libraries like `numpy` or `pandas` for better performance.\n",
      "- **Readability:** Well-structured code is easier to read and maintain. Use clear variable names and comments where necessary.\n",
      "\n",
